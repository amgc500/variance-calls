# variance-calls

This is the current version of the code described in the paper "Optimal robust bounds for variance options" by Alexander M. G. Cox and Jiajie Wang. The paper can be found at http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.4363

The code constructs barrier functions for given call prices, and computes the outcome for a hedger who uses these methods to sub/super-hedge the corresponding option.

The version of the code used at for producing the figures in particular version of the paper can be found in branches of the code.
